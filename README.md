# Data-Analysis

This repository contains two main components:

## 1. Data Analysis Project
This project, which focused on conducting an end-to-end data analysis process on a chosen dataset, was created using Google Colab. Data preprocessing, data cleaning, and feature handling were among the key steps in the workflow. Insightful visualizations were then created using a variety of Python libraries.

## 2. AI Guardian: Intelligent Streetlight & Surveillance Network

A complete AI-powered surveillance system designed for crime and emergency detection using modern Python technologies and beautiful UI design.
